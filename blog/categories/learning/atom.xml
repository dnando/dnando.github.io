    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a programmer. Learning new technologies and techniques is essential to what I do. However, I have noticed lately that learning has become burdened - burdened with time pressure, lots of time pressure; burdened with the sheer volume, diversity and complexity of all the things it seems I <em>must</em> learn to keep up, burdened with the feeling that I am falling ever further behind the hundreds of thousands of brilliant programmers that are constantly pushing our field forward, in every direction, a constantly expanding universe that includes everything from server administration to user interface design to unit / integration testing and a plethora of languages and frameworks that are used to develop web applications. Sum all that up, and to me, learning has become burdened with a fear that I simply won&rsquo;t be able to keep up.</p>

<p>The truth is that I really enjoy learning new things. I feel that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I like programming, why I was attracted to it in the first place. And you know, looking at it clearly, my fear is <em>entirely</em> justified. There is no way in the world for a working programming to keep up with the whole field. It&rsquo;s just too bloody big. And complex. So how can I deal with this situation?</p>

<p>Here is my proposal, to myself. What about taking one <em>small</em> bite at a time? What about simply enjoying the flavor, the taste of learning something new, as it is happening? On a practical basis, I don&rsquo;t have a choice. The field is waayy too big to consume in one go. But on a personal level, I <em>do</em> have a choice.</p>

<p>So this blog is my space for learning new stuff. I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m going to redefine my attitude toward learning. Until now, it has seemed that if I&rsquo;m going to keep up, I have to gulp everything down as quickly as possible. Well, that doesn&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;m left somewhat confused and overwhelmed, and I don&rsquo;t really learn anything, not in a way that I can practically use.</p>

<p>This blog is for taking small bites, chewing things over, and enjoying what I&rsquo;m learning.</p>
